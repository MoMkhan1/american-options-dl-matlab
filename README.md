# American Options Pricing with Deep Learning (MATLAB)
This repository implements a deep learning framework for pricing American-style options using Monte Carlo simulation and neural network-based approximation of continuation values. The project accompanies the master’s thesis:

“Pricing and Hedging American-Style Options with Deep Learning: Algorithmic Implementation” (Uppsala University).

## 🧠 Thesis Summary

The thesis proposes a deep learning approach for solving optimal stopping problems in financial mathematics. American-style options are priced by simulating asset price paths and using a deep neural network to approximate continuation values. The algorithm provides both a price estimate and a verified lower bound.
